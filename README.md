I will leave the description up for this program written in the code it's written in.  I refactored the program into C, and made a few adjustments to it, and switched to Windows.  I am not 100% sure if I want to publish my work ornot.  I didn't get an overwhelming response from the start of this program, and if I can't get a team together with the basic idea, I don't know if I'm confortable showing them what I have gotten it to in a couple days... It's evolving to be much much much more then a system of note taking..... And I don't know what else to say I guess.  If you try this and wonder what it's developed into, and have some skills yourself, try to message me somehow.  It disapoints me that despite throwing my first programs online, I didn't get any responses.  I guess that's the reality behind not knowing what you're doing very well.  The program did suck in a way.  But it's going to be a work of art.  I just wish I had 1 guy who knew as much as I do, who was interested in jumping into my ideas.  That's all it would take for me to be able to make a serious push at completion for varieties of systems that are all slowly but surly comming together into 1 massive system.




This program is freekin sweet.  Inspired by the life energy of children, who loved the colors of the Note program in Linux Mint.

It was then added with the life energy of various AI programmers, who were trying to help me make a system which could bipass what was supposed to be failed context windows, but ultimatly ended up being associated with a variety of viruses! lol..

So what became of the problems?  Well, a system of templates, which helped you cut down context windows, and keep everything in order.

The concept is somewhat complex and somewhat simple at the same time.  Just like everything around me!  You have notes.  They have colors.  Unlike Notes, we also have black, white, and grey.  I was hoping to add some colors which have variety and spice.  Like the center of the "Marble" template from Warp.  Just cause colors made me happy.  Gotta love educational motivations of a 3 year old.  My niece.

At any rate, the templates are simple.  Code editor, which has Theia integrated into the code.  Now, I don't really know what I'm doing when I integrated Theia to be honest.  But I understood the concepts.  I could end up loading various CLI based extensions, and use those tools to help assist with AI coding tasks.

There are note templates, which can act like prompts.  Those note templates have a variety of coding systems.  Colors and Tags.  Each color can represent a Description, and Instructions.  So Blue, is for Program Progress.  When you have a blue note, the Tag, 115ZPQ4, may signify that code is to be written into a Red Code Editor Template, labled as 1447Z148... Okay, making some of those lables over complicated.  But.. Your instructions are pretty simple stupid.

Then you may tell the computer, at a spot in the notes, you want it to take a Screen Shot, and add a picture template of the progress, to a white note, tag Pic145U8.  

The picture editor then in turn, is supposed to have the ability to make text boxes.  Which the user can use to create notes for the AI, to understand and signify the identification of areas in the screen shot, which are supposed to be modified.  So I have for example, INSERT NAME-    That box ends up saying INSERT-     I now have an edit.  I can trace out a text box, and explain to the AI, that this feature is incorrect.  It was supposed to say "Insert Name" and then have an entry box, which I can use to represent a string, "Name".  And then save "Name" as "Name" which becomes the string "Name" for all features which involve the name in the program....  Trying to make it semi-technical and simple stupid... 

At any rate, if you can get the AI to follow along on this system, you can cut down context windows, have it create and update it's own systems of notes, and instructions, and templates, using various context window lengths... Ultimatly, possibly.. giving it the ability to do a few unique things.

1, it can use loops, and then use simple mathematics to choose how to follow those loops, so it can reiderate commands.  So I say, in Note Pink, 149Y8 that you are to take the variable at the bottom, and subtract 1.  If the variable at the bottom is greater then 0, continue to the next instruction.  The next instruction says go back to Note Yellow 43PY... Simple thing right.  Then what I can do is take GPT mini for example, and have it go thorugh it's process of note taking, 3-4 times, to check and ensure that it's not failing at it's task.  

It gives it windows to reiderate, and it then gives it windows to write code, and again can in turn re-iderate to have it re-write and check it's code.

If you're super smart about this idea, you can assume a context window of input and output, to chunk everything into a varity of segments, which can be evaluted properly.  In addition, you can write tags, and other things which can help describe the program trees.  So instead of just saying, Okay, I want you to go from note 1-10.  You can say go from 1-3, 5-8, and 300-303, to make sure that the concepts of your tags are included.

The idea starts to get more advanced, because you can focus the AI it's self, to actually do all the work.  Making it's own trees, and it's own notes, and keeping it's own organization of structure.  And evaluating the needs based on the tokens in and the tokens out.  So what you end up with is an AI that can say use 10,000 input tokens, and 5,000 output tokens, and still be able to chunk a variety of contexts ito a variety of segments, and not even necessarily need memory.

The answers I was given in the event I had to continue my work with a 30B parameter model.  

Everyone in my brain was pretty supportive.  And relaized I was poor, and destined for failure.  They tried hard to help design a system of simplicity which took the most basic garbage a broke person like myself could afford and possibly make work.  I have the people in large to thank for these concepts.  People struggeling all over, who simply could not truly afford the $10 a month sometimes for a Github subscription, looking for solutions, took despiration and drove it towards a solution.

This is the start of that solution.  This is only a piece of what has been created in light of the whole problem with not having enough computer to accomplish anything.  I have other programs, and ideas, which take the inability to produce proper hardware, and can turn a simple process, into a possible success.

They are not giving the people what they could give them to make this all easier.  They are slamming the market with Hardware demanding, overwhelming chunks of what they give us to try and sell things.  There are easier ways.  There are better ways... And if you apply these simple stupid concepts to a more advanced AI... It only makes that AI even more effective.

So... If you take my idea and run off with it, please, do me a favor... Don't just run away.  Come back and try to help give me a few chunks in return.  I have more in my brain.  I have been sitting around dreaming about the day I had my own AI for probably 6-7 or more years.  When we were children, I always swore I would some day grow up and help design AI...  I did not accomplish that task.  I got poor.  Everyone else around me became a psychologist, and a computer scientist.  I was discounted as a failure, and ended up learning through life, more intricate realities of sociology and psycology then many practitioners can comprehend... Which is all okay.  We all take our path.  My path has to variate from everyone elses, or my contribution is just a repetitive template.

You need various templates, to be contrasted with a higher model.  You take 2 incomplete ideas, and have them evaluated with another somewhat incomplete system.. Often times you end up with a complete answer... All the grinds from those who just weren't that good... Taught me this part.. You don't have to be smart.  You just have to realize that smarter things then you exist, and exploit those for what they're worth.

Good luck if you try to take up this program.  The notes need to be more portable.  They need to be able to be saved and transfered from preferably all systems.  Android, Linux, Windows.  And of course, the Android transfer seems to be a real real MFSOB... As the whole x86 to Arm thing has proven to be a lot harder then I thought.

But if I could personally work on my stuff on my Tablet, and then take it back to my Linux computer, and then if I need pull it back to my Windows computer... I think that would be cool.

You might even be able to throw a 3-D printing blue-print Template into the design.. I don't know why you would do that, but I'm working more on 3-D printing, because I get attacked less... So it's just easier for me to stay away from AI mostly.  When I go back, I'm probably going to have to start kicking people's telepathic ass.... Which I am actually pretty good at.  I can't write the best code.. But I can torture you... And that my friends, is worth helping me write code... Lol... Jokes.. well.. not really.




# Note Book

A GTK-based sticky notes application with integrated file organization and optional web-based code editing through Theia IDE evaluation.

## Features

- **Sticky Notes**: Quick note taking with persistent storage
- **File Organization**: Organize notes by projects and categories
- **Optional Theia IDE Integration**: Web-based code editing (install via github-install.sh)
- **Progress Tracking**: Track progress notes and milestones
- **GTK3 UI**: Native Linux desktop interface

## Quick Start

### System Requirements

Install GTK3 and Python bindings:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

```bash
bash install.sh
```

This will:
1. Verify Python 3 and GTK3 are installed
2. Verify all dependencies
3. Display launch instructions

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Verify system packages
python3 -c "import gi; gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0'); from gi.repository import Gtk"
```

## Running Note Book

### Using the Launcher Script
```bash
bash LAUNCH_PROGRAM.sh
```

### Using Desktop Launcher
Click the **Note Book** application in your application menu.

### Direct Python
```bash
cd Files
python3 manager.py
```

## Requirements

### System Packages
- python3-gi
- gir1.2-gtk-3.0
- libgtk-3-0

### Python
- Python 3.7+
- GTK3 (system library)

## Optional: Theia IDE Integration

Theia Evaluation provides a web-based code editor interface. To install:

```bash
bash github-install.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check for existing Theia installation
2. Prompt user to install theia-evaluation
3. Set up the optional component for web-based code editing

**Note**: Theia is completely optional. Note Book works perfectly fine without it.

## Project Structure

```
Note Book/
├── LAUNCH_PROGRAM.sh           # Main launcher
├── install.sh                  # Installation script
├── github-install.sh           # GitHub optional components installer
├── Files/
│   ├── manager.py              # Main application
│   ├── note_extended.py        # Note extension module
│   └── notes/                  # Stored notes
├── Progress Notes/             # Progress tracking
└── README.md                   # This file
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Creating Notes**: Use the GUI to create new sticky notes
2. **Organizing**: Drag notes into categories
3. **Searching**: Use the search feature to find notes quickly
4. **Backing Up**: Notes are stored in `Files/notes/` directory
5. **Web Editing**: After running github-install.sh, use Theia for editing code or complex notes

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Launch
Verify GTK3 is installed:
```bash
python3 -c "import gi; gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0'); from gi.repository import Gtk; print('GTK3 OK')"
```

### Import Errors
Re-run `bash install.sh` to verify all dependencies.

### Theia Not Available
If you want web-based code editing, run:
```bash
bash github-install.sh
```

### Display Issues
If running over SSH, ensure X11 forwarding is enabled:
```bash
ssh -X user@host
```

## Performance Notes

- Application is lightweight for note-taking
- Theia IDE (if installed) can be memory-intensive (requires significant RAM)
- Theia is optional and does not impact core Note Book functionality
